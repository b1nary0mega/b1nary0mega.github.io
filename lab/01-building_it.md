Click next.

Leave the default options for paths and click next until you are at the "Prerequisites Check" screen. 
Click "install".

#### Conclusion
At this point you have a fully functional DC with AD CS web services setup. 
It is **HIGHLY** encouraged you export an OVA for backup purposes.
I would also recommend you get in the habit of creating a snapshot before doinging any additional work. Once the work has been performed, and changes confirmed, merge the snapshot back to a base image.
