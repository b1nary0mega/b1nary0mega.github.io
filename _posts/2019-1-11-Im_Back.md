So, after some time I've finally gotten around to updating this. Most likely there will not be a ton of content going on here, but I will utilize it to store, note, or otherwise just catalog some of my more glorious life achievements. If you're into checking out those kinds of things on others (no judgement here), stay tuned.

That being said, I still have my books!
